Processing Sentinel Data
================

In this repository, introductory workflows about how to process data sensed by the Sentinels of ESA's Copernicus project will be summarised. Some of the workflows are alternative ways on how to use SNAP and its interfaces for specific topics, which where introduced by [RUS-training](https://rus-training.eu/) in the first place.

The idea of this repo is to answer the same or similar questions but have a focus on automated or semi automated processing using snappy, the gpt interface and bash scripting. The goal is to become capable of scaling up processing chains in time and space and therefore do not rely on GUI based workflows.

Overarching topics like setting up the processing environment can be found here, just open the .html file of interest and follow the instructions. All other topics, related to a specific member of the Sentinel family, can be found in the folder named like the sensor. Just open a folder and search for a topic that you want to know more about.

For more discussions about the Sentinels and the toolboxes in SNAP, I highly recommend the [Step Forum](https://forum.step.esa.int/), see you there!
